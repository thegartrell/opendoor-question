# Opendoor Frontend Interview Question

Build an App that allows users to create timers to track a variety of tasks.

- The user can start and stop individual timers
- Users can add and remove timers
- When the user clicks on the add timer button, a dialog appears allowing them to name the timer.

Your components should look like this:
